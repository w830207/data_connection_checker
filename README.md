### data_connection_checker

[![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/data_connection_checker.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/data_connection_checker)

A pure Dart utility library that checks for an internet connection by opening a socket to a list of specified addresses, each with individual port and timeout. Defaults are provided for convenience.

>*Note that this plugin is in beta and may still have
a few issues. [Feedback][issues_tracker] is welcome.*

## Description

Checks for an internet (data) connection, by opening a socket to a list of addresses.

The defaults of the plugin should be sufficient to reliably determine if
the device is currently connected to the global network, e.i. has access to the Internet.

>Note that you should not be using the current network status for deciding whether you can reliably make a network connection. Always guard your app code against timeouts and errors that might come from the network layer.

## Quick start

`DataConnectionChecker()` is actually a Singleton. Calling `DataConnectionChecker()`
is guaranteed to always return the same instance.

You can supply a new list to `DataConnectionChecker().addresses` if you
need to check different destinations, ports and timeouts.
Also, each address can have its own port and timeout.
See `InternetAddressCheckOptions` in the docs for more info.

***First you need to [install it][install] (this is the preferred way)***

Then you can start using the library:

```dart
bool result = await DataConnectionChecker().hasConnection;
if(result == true) {
  print('YAY! Free cute dog pics!');
} else {
  print('No internet :( Reason:');
  print(DataConnectionChecker().lastTryResults);
}
```

## Purpose

The reason this package exists is that `connectivity` package cannot reliably determine if a data connection is actually available. More info on its page here: <https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity>

More info on the issue in general:

- <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1560788/how-to-check-internet-access-on-android-inetaddress-never-times-out/27312494#27312494> (this is the best approach so far IMO and it's what I'm using)

You can use this package in combination with `connectivity` in the following way:

```dart
var isDeviceConnected = false;

var subscription = Connectivity().onConnectivityChanged.listen((ConnectivityResult result) async {
  if(result != ConnectivityResult.none) {
    isDeviceConnected = await DataConnectionChecker().hasConnection;
  }
});
```

*Note: remember to properly cancel the `subscription` when it's no longer needed. See `connectivity` package docs for more info.*

## How it works

All addresses are pinged simultaneously. On successful result (socket connection to address/port succeeds) a `true` boolean is pushed to a list, on failure (usually on timeout, default 10 sec) a `false` boolean is pushed to the same list.

When all the requests complete with either success or failure, a check is made to see if the list contains at least one `true` boolean. If it does, then an external address is available, so we have data connection. If all the values in this list are `false`, then we have no connection to the outside world of cute cat and dog pictures, so `hasConnection` also returns `false` too.

This all happens at the same time for all addresses, so the maximum waiting time is the address with the highest specified timeout, in case it's unreachable.

I believe this is a ***reliable*** and ***fast*** method to check if a data connection is available to a device, but I may be wrong. I suggest you open an issue on the Github repository page if you have a better way of.

## Defaults

The defaults are based on data collected from <https://perfops.net/>, <https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers>

Here's some more info about the defaults:

#### `DEFAULT_ADDRESSES`

... includes the top 3 globally available free DNS resolvers.

| Address        | Provider   | Info                                              |
| :------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.1.1.1        | CloudFlare | <https://1.1.1.1>                                 |
| 1.0.0.1        | CloudFlare | <https://1.1.1.1>                                 |
| 8.8.8.8        | Google     | <https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/> |
| 8.8.4.4        | Google     | <https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/> |
| 180.76.76.76   | Baidu      | https://dudns.baidu.com/                          |
| 208.67.222.222 | OpenDNS    | <https://use.opendns.com/>                        |
| 208.67.220.220 | OpenDNS    | <https://use.opendns.com/>                        |

```dart
static final List<AddressCheckOptions> DEFAULT_ADDRESSES = List.unmodifiable([
  AddressCheckOptions(
    InternetAddress('1.1.1.1'),
    port: DEFAULT_PORT,
    timeout: DEFAULT_TIMEOUT,
  ),
  AddressCheckOptions(
    InternetAddress('180.76.76.76'),
    port: DEFAULT_PORT,
    timeout: DEFAULT_TIMEOUT,
  ),
  AddressCheckOptions(
    InternetAddress('208.67.222.222'),
    port: DEFAULT_PORT,
    timeout: DEFAULT_TIMEOUT,
  ),
]);
```

#### `DEFAULT_PORT`

... is 53.

>A DNS server listens for requests on port 53 (both UDP and TCP). So all DNS requests are sent to port 53 ...

More info:

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers>
- <https://www.google.com/search?q=dns+server+port>

```dart
static const int DEFAULT_PORT = 53;
```

#### `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`

... is 10 seconds.

```dart
static const Duration DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = Duration(seconds: 10);
```

#### `DEFAULT_INTERVAL`

... is 10 seconds. Interval is the time between automatic checks. Automatic
checks start if there's a listener attached to `onStatusChange`, thus remember
to cancel unneeded subscriptions.

`checkInterval` (which controls how often a check is made) defaults
to this value. You can change it if you need to perform checks more often
or otherwise.

```dart
static const Duration DEFAULT_INTERVAL = const Duration(seconds: 10);
...
Duration checkInterval = DEFAULT_INTERVAL;
```

## Usage

Example:

```dart
import 'package:data_connection_checker/data_connection_checker.dart';

main() async {
  // Simple check to see if we have internet
  print("The statement 'this machine is connected to the Internet' is: ");
  print(await DataConnectionChecker().hasConnection);
  // returns a bool

  // We can also get an enum value instead of a bool
  print("Current status: ${await DataConnectionChecker().connectionStatus}");
  // prints either DataConnectionStatus.connected
  // or DataConnectionStatus.disconnected

  // This returns the last results from the last call
  // to either hasConnection or connectionStatus
  print("Last results: ${DataConnectionChecker().lastTryResults}");

  // actively listen for status updates
  // this will cause DataConnectionChecker to check periodically
  // with the interval specified in DataConnectionChecker().checkInterval
  // until listener.cancel() is called
  var listener = DataConnectionChecker().onStatusChange.listen((status) {
    switch (status) {
      case DataConnectionStatus.connected:
        print('Data connection is available.');
        break;
      case DataConnectionStatus.disconnected:
        print('You are disconnected from the internet.');
        break;
    }
  });

  // close listener after 30 seconds, so the program doesn't run forever
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 30));
  await listener.cancel();
}
```

*Note: Remember to dispose of any listeners,
when they're not needed to prevent memory leaks,
e.g. in a* `StatefulWidget`'s *dispose() method*:
  
```dart
...
@override
void dispose() {
  listener.cancel();
  super.dispose();
}
...
```
